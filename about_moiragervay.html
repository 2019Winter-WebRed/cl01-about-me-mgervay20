        <p>Hey there! My name is <b>Moira Gervay</b>. I am 17 years old, and I am a Junior at <b>Padua Academy</b>. I am the oldest of three.

        <p>My favorite quote is:</p>
        
        <blockquote> For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. -Audrey Hepburn </blockquote> 
        <!-- The next paragraph is all about my love of art--> 
        <p>I love art! In college, I want to major in Graphic Design/Illustration. I know how to use Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I've been creating art for as long as I can remember. This year, I am a part of Publication Design, also known as Yearbook, and I got to design the cover! I like making logos, posters, and other illustrations.</p>
        <!-- This paragraph is about being an actress and working in Padua Theatre--> 
        <p> I also participate in Padua Theatre. This is my third year being a part of it, and it is one of the best things I have ever done. The cast is like a family to me, and I've met some of my best friends through the program. I love the rush of performing on stage, and the applause is pretty great, too.</p>
